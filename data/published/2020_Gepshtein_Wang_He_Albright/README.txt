There are four data files associated with this project.

Data from all subjects in the paired comparison (PAR) condition are deposited in two files:
- DATA_PAR_TP.txt for the Target Present condition (TP)
- DATA_PAR_TA.txt for the Target Absent condition (TA)

In both files, the data appear in six columns:
column 1: subject identification number
column 2: trial number
column 3: face number in the left position
column 4: face number in the right position
column 5: face number of the face selected by the subject
column 6: whether the choice is left (0) or right (1)

Data from all subjects in traditional lineup conditions are deposited in two files:
- DATA_SIM.txt for the simultaneous condition (SIM)
- DATA_SEQ.txt for the sequential condition (SEQ)

In both files, the data appear in two columns:
column 1: subject identification number
column 2: face number of the face selected by the subject

In column 2, entry "0" indicates that the subject selected no face (i.e., he or she rejected the lineup).

In the SIM, SEQ, and PAR_TP conditions, face 1 was the target (i.e., the correct choice). In the PAR_TA conditions, face 1 was a filler that replaced the target.
