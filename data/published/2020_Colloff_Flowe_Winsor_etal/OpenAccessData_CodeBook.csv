PreIDConfidence,"Confidence before identification decision: ""How sure are you that you would be able to recognise James if you saw him again in a group of photos?"". Rated using water-cup rating scale: empty cup (0), 1/4 cup (10), 1/2 cup (20), 3/4 cup (30),  full cup (40)",,,,
Confidence,"Confidence in identification decision: ""How sure are you that that is James / James is not present."" Rated using water-cup rating scale: empty cup (0), 1/4 cup (10), 1/2 cup (20), 3/4 cup (30),  full cup (40)",,,,
Interacted,Researchers coded whether the subject interacted or not. Interacted = subject clicked on and rotated at least one face; None = subject did not click on and rotate any faces,,,,
MouseMovements,"Subject's mouse movements (interactivity data), when presented with the interactive lineup, in the form =[[a,b,c],[a,b,c].... , where a= the location of the lineup member in the lineup array that the subject clicked on to rotate (1 =  top left, 2 = top middle, 3 = top right, 4 = bottom left, 5 = bottom middle, 6 = bottom right); b = the facial region that was entered when the lineup face was moved (0 = lineup member's left profile, to 17 = lineup member's front profile, to 35 = lineup member's right profile); and c = time when the lineup face entered a new region (timed in ms, since the lineup faces appeared on screen).",,,,

Total Interaction Time,"Researchers calculated the total length of time that each subject interacted with the lineup faces (ms), NA = the subject did not interact",,,,
MouseGroup,"Researchers coded subjects into low and high interators, using a median split on 'TotalInteractionTime' in each age group (young, middle, late). Low = interacted less than the median time; High = interacted more that the median time; NA = the subject did not interact.",,,,
ChildAlone,"RAs noted if they believed that the child responded independently (i.e., whether guardian influenced the child's answers). No = guardian was believed to have influenced the child's answers, Yes = guardian did not influence the child's answers",,,,
